Access to this data is governed by the [Ethics in Government Act of 1978](https://legcounsel.house.gov/Comps/Ethics%20In%20Government%20Act%20Of%201978.pdf) stating:

1. It shall be unlawful for any person to obtain or use a report:
    1. for any unlawful purpose;
    2. for any commercial purpose, other than by news and communications media for dissemination to the general public;
    3. for determining or establishing the credit rating of any individual; or
    4. for use, directly or indirectly, in the solicitation of money for any political, charitable, or other purpose.
2. The Attorney General may bring a civil action against any person who obtains or uses a report for any purpose prohibited in paragraph (1) of this subsection. The court in which such action is brought may assess against such person a penalty in any amount not to exceed $10,000. Such remedy shall be in addition to any other remedy available under statutory or common law.
